## What have I been reading lately?

This application shows what I am currently reading, and has functionality to update the book, along with keep track of the pages I have read. 


The application also has a dashboard page that shows some statistics of my reading data over the last few years. 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

#### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
